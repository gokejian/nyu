// Token table #4 for warm-up project
// This is meant to correspond to the SiC language from the big project description.
// Please report bugs.
// You may need to back slash quote some of the special characters.
// In our scanner specification I forgot to mention one should have a separate category for comments, which are not really tokens and should be ignored.
// Notes:
// 1.  Comments DO NOT fit in the description of the warm-up project, as they may contain newlines.  They should fit a regex which is a little complicated and you should not really just skip them, but also count the lines, in order for the error reporting to work properly.
// 2.  White space is ignored, except as a separator; newlines are used for counting lines.  This is not really expressed in the table below.
// 3.  I put in a single token for both binary and unary minus.
