testSharedMemoryCreate.c
  - Sets up the shared memory.  
    If no argument, then the system is directed to provide a key.
    Otherwise use the argument as a file name to be used by ftok to create a key.

testSharedMemoryRead.c
  - Reads what testSharedMemory wrote to the shared segment.
    If no argument, then the system is directed to provide a key.
    Otherwise use the argument as a file name to be used by ftok to create a key.

  - Releases the system resources for the shared memory.
    After running this, then running testSharedMemoryRead will report an error.
