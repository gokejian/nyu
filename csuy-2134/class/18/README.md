binary tree: a tree with each node having a maximum of two children

binary search tree: A binary search tree which enforces the property that the value of all nodes on the left subtree are less than the value of the node. The value of all nodes on the right subtree are greater than or equal to the value of the node.

Insertion takes log(n)

### tree traversal
- pre order: TLR
- in order: LTR
- post order: LRT
- level order: breadth first
