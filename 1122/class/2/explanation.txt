Mystery1()
This is attempting to sort but it is not working because it doesn't have a temp variable to hold the of the next item.
Instead, it is being overwritten directly effectively leaving the current element the same while changing the next element to the current.

Mystery2()
This is attempting to do an in place shift but it fails to take into account shifting past the 0 index, leaving the first n elements the same and duplicating it at the end of the list.

Mystery3()
This is designed to find the difference between the number given and the smallest multiple of the second number that is greater than the first number. It does so successfully
