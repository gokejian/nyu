# Homework 1

## Build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

## Notes
Run the program with `./hw1` and it will ask which part to run.

### Part C
For part c, please enter the coordinates and radius. e.g. `150 150 150`. This takes in the screen coordinates.

### Part D
This will read `input_circles.txt` and draw the circles based off of the data read.

### Part E
This will read `input_circles.txt` and draw the circles with animation.
