We are using a dataset containing data for earthquakes around the world, and our goal here is to identify places where the largest earthquakes happened as well as regions where it is more likely for an earthquake to happen.

Your page should:

1. Show a World Map.

2. The map should use the `geoNaturalEarth1` projection

3. The map should include a graticule and a border around the map

4. The color for each country should be mapped to the largest earthquake's magnitude that happened in the given country (`largestEarthquakes.csv`) mapping colors `#5e3c99`, `#ffffbf` and `#e66101` mapping to the minimum, mean and maximum magnitudes respectively.

5. The map should also show a dot for each earthquake on `earthquakes.csv`
