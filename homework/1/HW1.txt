1. A combination lock has the following basic properties: the combination (a sequence of three numbers) is hidden; the lock can be opened by providing the combination; and the combination can be changed but only by someone who knows the current combination.  Design a class with public member functions open and changeCombo and private data members that store the combination.  The combination should be set in the constructor.  Disable copying of combination locks.  In addition, your lock should keep a state open/close.  Design the class with those properties.

2. Design a templated class called DynArray which is effectivly a vector.  The only difference between a DynArray and a vector is that once the square bracket operator has been used, push_back can not be used on the same object.  You may not use a vector in your answer.  You need only create the constructors, destructors, push_back, pop_back, square bracket operator, size, capacity and resize functions.

3. You are designing a program which will be used in a point of sale system.  Every item in our system has an item number (integer) and a price (double).  You are given a file filled with the list of all items and their prices (see attachment).  Write a function which will receive a map with the data in the file and a vector of the items which the user is purchasing.  Return a double of the total cost of those items.  You should also write a main to test this function.
