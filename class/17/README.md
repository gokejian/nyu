### Tree
A hierarchial data structure with parent/child relationships. Each node has one, and only one, parent.

`root`: the only node in the node with no parent  
`leaves`: a node with no children  
`full`: a node which contains the maximum number of children  
`height`: the distance from the node (or root) to the farthest leaf  
`size`: the number of nodes on the tree  
`depth`: the distance of the node from the root  
`breadth`: the maximum width of the tree

storage mechanism:  
- parent multi-child
- parent-child-sibling

searching:  
- breadth first
- depth first
