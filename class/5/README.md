# Lecture 5

controlling line of code: code that runs more times as elements are added

- constant `O(1)`
- logarithmic `O(log(n))`
- linear`O(n)`
	- constant rate of growth
- `O(n*log(n))`
- quadratic `O(n^2)`
- cubic `O(n^3)`
- exponential `O(2^n)`


- Big Theta: exact function depicting growth of complexity
- Big O: upper bound
	- only look at biggest term


`func3`
(n (n - 1)) / 2 = (1/2)*n^2 - (1/2)*n
Big Theta: (1/2)*n^2 - (1/2)*n
Big O: n^2 [O(n^2)]
